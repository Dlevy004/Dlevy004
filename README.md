## 🚀 Current projects

**Pátyod Klíma Full-Stack Web App** <br>
Developing a dynamic web application to replace the previous static site. My goal is to create a ***CMS system*** that allows the client to independently manage advertisements and references, as well as automate the sales process.

**Thesis - Unity 3D Game Development** <br>
A ***story-driven psychological horror*** experience played from a first-person perspective. The game features a choice system with a focus on narrative depth and atmospheric storytelling.

## 🏆 Certifications

I believe in continuous learning, so I aim to complete online courses (freeCodeCamp), tutorials, or industrial certifications.

- **Unity Certified User: Programmer** (2026) - *Unity Technologies*
